# Bandit Level 5 â†’ 6

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
Locate the file owned by `bandit6` in `/var/lib/dpkg/info`.

## ðŸ¤” Thought Process  
I narrowed `find` to that directory and filtered results by user and group, then read the only matching file to get the password.

## ðŸ”§ Commands Used
```bash
find /var/lib/dpkg/info -user bandit6 -group bandit5 2>/dev/null
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/<found-file>
exit
