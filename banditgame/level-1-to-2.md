# Bandit Level 1 â†’ 2

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
Find and read the file named `-` to obtain the Level 2 password.

## ðŸ¤” Thought Process  
After logging in, I saw a file named `-`. Knowing `cat -` reads stdin, I prefixed it with `./` so the shell treated it as a filename, then read it to get the password.

## ðŸ”§ Commands Used
```bash
ls
cat ./-
exit
