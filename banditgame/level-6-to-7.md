# Bandit Level 6 â†’ 7

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
Identify and execute the only file marked as executable.

## ðŸ¤” Thought Process  
I used `find` with `-executable` to list executables, then ran the discovered file directly to display the password.

## ðŸ”§ Commands Used
```bash
find . -type f -executable
./<found-file>
exit
