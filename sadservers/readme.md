# SadServers – Linux Troubleshooting Challenges 🐧

This repository will contain my solutions and notes for [SadServers.com](https://sadservers.com/) — a platform offering real-world Linux troubleshooting scenarios used in technical interviews and sysadmin assessments.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The repo is currently empty — but it will be updated progressively as I work through the challenges.

## 🧠 Purpose

To sharpen my Linux debugging and system administration skills by tackling realistic issues involving:

- Systemd & service failures  
- Disk space & inode issues  
- Network misconfigurations  
- SSH access problems  
- Log analysis  
- Permission & user errors  
- And more…

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

- `journalctl`, `systemctl`, `dmesg`  
- `lsof`, `du`, `df`, `find`, `stat`  
- `tcpdump`, `netstat`, `ss`, `ip`, `ping`  
- `chroot`, `passwd`, `sudo`, `useradd`  
- `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, `sort`, `xargs`

## 📁 Structure

Each challenge will be organized and documented as I complete them.
